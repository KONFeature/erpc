> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is still under development, and for now should be used as "a fallback" for RPC calls.

[eRPC](https://erpc.cloud/) is a fault-tolerant EVM RPC proxy and re-org aware permanent caching solution. It is built with read-heavy use-cases in mind such as data indexing and high-load frontend usage.

# Features

‚úÖ Retries, circuit-breakers, failovers and hedged requests make sure fastest most-reliable upstream is used. <br/>
‚úÖ Define hourly, daily rate limits for each upstream provider, to control usage, costs and high-scale usage.<br/>
‚úÖ Avoid redundant upstream costs by locally caching RPC responses, with reorg-aware caching layer.<br/>
‚úÖ You don't need to think about which upstream supports which `eth_*` method; eRPC automatically does that.<br/>
‚úÖ Receive consistent error codes with details across 5+ third-party providers and reporting of occured errors.<br/>
‚úÖ Single dashboard to observe rps throughput, errors, and avg. latency of all your RPC providers.<br/>
üè≠ Smart batching to aggregates multiple RPC or contract calls into one.<br/>
üè≠ Authentication modules such as basic auth, key-based, JWT and SIWE.<br/>
